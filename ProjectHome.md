Hey everyone! I just got back to business and I'm improving aidSQL's code structure plus adding some other functionality to it. I'm currently looking for people who can contribute doing BASH SCRIPTING. I'm now doing a small test site installer for using aidSQL locally and I'm in need of bash scripters, if you are one/known one, send me an email.

Cheers!
